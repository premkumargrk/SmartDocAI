# SmartDocAI
A RAG-Based Intelligent Document Assistant


-> About this project:
In the digital era, individuals and organizations often interact with a large volume of unstructured documents such as PDFs, Word files, and PowerPoint presentations. Extracting meaningful insights or answers from these documents can be time-consuming and inefficient. To address this challenge, this project introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based intelligent document assistant, which enables users to upload various document formats and ask natural language questions to receive accurate, context-based answers generated by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).
